PCA 

Benefit 1: It helps with dimensionality reduction, which makes things faster by reducing the size of dataset 
to be stored and processed

Benefit 2: Removes Correlated Features, PCA does this for you efficiently.  After implementing the PCA on your dataset, all the 
Principal Components are independent of one another. There is no correlation among them.

Improves Algorithm Performance
Improves Visualization: It is very hard to visualize and understand the data in high dimensions. PCA transforms a high dimensional data 
to low dimensional data (2 dimension) so that it can be visualized easily. 
We can use 2D Scree Plot to see which Principal Components result in high variance and have more impact as compared to other 
Principal Components.
